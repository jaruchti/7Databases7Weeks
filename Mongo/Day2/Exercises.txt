1) Implement a finalize method to output the count as the total.
finalize = function(key, value){
  return { total : value.count }; // simply rename the count variable to total
}

db.runCommand({
  mapReduce: 'phones'
  map: map
  reduce: reduce,
  finalize: finalize,
  out: 'phones.report'
});

2) Install a Mongo driver for a language of your choice, and connect to the database. 
Populate a collection through it, and index one of the fields.

I didn't see much value added with this exercises, so I decided to move on to Day #3.
My goal is to learn more about database technologies, not how to interface with them
through a programming languages.
